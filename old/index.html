            <blockquote>
              Booze Époque effectively realizes a tricky vibe &mdash; half
              nostalgic romance, half meta-aware postmodern inside joke.
              Fortunately, after a few of their creative, hand-sculpted
              cocktails, you won't want to think about that intellectual
              stuff too much. I feel justified in conjecturing that if
              Matisse were alive today, Matisse would hire BÉ for all of
              his soir&eacute;e-ing needs.

              Harmony &amp; Meaghan of Booze Époque created near-magical
              cocktails for my party. They were truly inspired, creative,
              and tasty. The founders exuded a warmth, friendliness, and
              enthusiasm for their work and the event. It was pleasure to
              have them. Beyond their wonderful drinks, it's the whole package
              and vibe of Booze  Époque that's outstanding.

              The divinely inspired ladies of Booze Époque were a tremendous
              hit at our last soirée.  They captured the essence of the
              evening in tasty and refreshing concoctions.  Fresh new takes
              on old standards, innovative new flavors, and enchanting
              service.  Simply wonderful!

              Hiring the ladies of Booze Epoque brings a level of fun and class to any event. Meaghan
              and Harmony are not only amazing mixologists but also have a lovely spirit that adds to the
              festivities. We had discussed, ahead of time, the cocktails that I wanted to serve and they
              took them to the highest level with their innovative, fresh ideas. Booze Époque catered at my
              backyard barbecue and all my guests are still talking about the cocktails and service 3 weeks
              later. They not only provided delicious drinks for the adult guests but also created, on the fly,
              fun mocktails for the kids that attended. Meaghan and Harmony have that perfect combination
              of knowledge, taste and joie de vivre that is a must-have for any party.
