          %p
            Booze Époque, a traveling high-end bartending service in the
            Greater Boston area, was conceptualized in 2011 by long-time
            friends Harmony Dawn and Meaghan Sinclair and launched in Spring
            of 2012. Inspired by the local food movement, nature walks and
            late night cocktails, Booze Époque crafts artful boutique
            beverages using fresh, seasonal ingredients for an array of
            parties and events.
          %p
            Driven by a desire to create splendid libations Meaghan and
            Harmony began experimenting with recipes focusing on strength
            of spirits, fresh fruits and homegrown herbs. Also inspired by
            years of hosting dinner parties, traveling, and fine dining
            they decided to embark on the journey of growing a business
            that delivers farm-to-table cocktail service directly to their
            clients.
          %img.ladies(src='images/be-ladies.jpg')

              Booze Époque effectively realizes a tricky vibe &mdash; half 
              nostalgic romance, half meta-aware postmodern inside joke. 
              Fortunately, after a few of their creative, hand-sculpted 
              cocktails, you won't want to think about that intellectual 
              stuff too much. I feel justified in conjecturing that if 
              Matisse were alive today, Matisse would hire BÉ for all of 
              his soir&eacute;e-ing needs.

              Harmony &amp; Meaghan of Booze Époque created near-magical 
              cocktails for my party. They were truly inspired, creative, 
              and tasty. The founders exuded a warmth, friendliness, and 
              enthusiasm for their work and the event. It was pleasure to 
              have them. Beyond their wonderful drinks, it's the whole package
              and vibe of Booze  Époque that's outstanding.

              The divinely inspired ladies of Booze Époque were a tremendous 
              hit at our last soirée.  They captured the essence of the 
              evening in tasty and refreshing concoctions.  Fresh new takes
              on old standards, innovative new flavors, and enchanting 
              service.  Simply wonderful!

              Hiring the ladies of Booze Epoque brings a level of fun and class to any event. Meaghan
              and Harmony are not only amazing mixologists but also have a lovely spirit that adds to the
              festivities. We had discussed, ahead of time, the cocktails that I wanted to serve and they
              took them to the highest level with their innovative, fresh ideas. Booze Époque catered at my
              backyard barbecue and all my guests are still talking about the cocktails and service 3 weeks
              later. They not only provided delicious drinks for the adult guests but also created, on the fly,
              fun mocktails for the kids that attended. Meaghan and Harmony have that perfect combination
              of knowledge, taste and joie de vivre that is a must-have for any party.
